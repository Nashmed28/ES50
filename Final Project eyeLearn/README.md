#eyeLearn

eyeLearn is the name of my final project for ES50. I worked with fellow classmates: Andrew Jiang, David Xu, and Sharanya Pulapura. The aim of eyeLearn was to create a device to provide an interactive way of learning Braille (the language used by the visually impaired).

Here's is our demo video: https://youtu.be/EQVL7ChpPO4
